# temporal-patterns-typescript

This repository demonstrates common [Temporal.io](https://temporal.io/) design patterns using HotMesh. Each example pattern is authored as a set of unit tests with assertions made against the runtime, showcasing various patterns and use cases. Each test case cleans the database state to ensure consistency and isolation for each run.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hotmeshio/temporal-patterns-typescript.git
   cd temporal-patterns-typescript
   ```
2. **Install** the dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Startup Docker
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
4. Exec `npm test` from within Docker
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

For detailed explanations of each pattern, see the pattern pages in the [HotMesh Temporal Patterns documentation](https://hotmeshio.github.io/sdk-typescript/).

### Pattern List 
 - [**Collation**](./patterns/collation): Demonstrates grouping tasks and merging results across workflow instances. 
 - [**Composition**](./patterns/composition): Highlights workflow composition, enabling modular and reusable task sequences.
 - [**Error (Unknown)**](./patterns/error-unknown): Handles unexpected errors in workflows with resilience strategies.
 - [**Error (Fatal)**](./patterns/error-fatal): Manages workflows with unrecoverable errors, ensuring a safe failure state.
 - [**Everything**](./patterns/everything): A comprehensive test case combining multiple patterns for a full integration scenario.
 - [**Transactional Hook**](./patterns/hook): Implements a hook mechanism for transactional workflow subprocess execution.
 - [**Idempotency**](./patterns/idempotency): Ensures tasks produce consistent outcomes across retries or repeated executions.
 - [**Interrupt**](./patterns/interrupt): Demonstrates pausing and resuming workflows based on external events.
 - [**Retry**](./patterns/retry): Shows retry mechanisms for tasks, defining custom retry intervals and strategies.
 - [**Search**](./patterns/search): Integrates search capabilities within workflows to retrieve relevant data dynamically.
 - [**Signal**](./patterns/signal): Uses signaling to awaken paused workflows from external inputs=.
 - [**Sleep**](./patterns/sleep): Demonstrates controlled delays and pausing workflows between tasks.
